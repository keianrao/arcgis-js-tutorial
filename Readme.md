# ArcGIS JS Tutorial

This is a followthrough of ArcGIS's JavaScript API ['Create a starter app' guide](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/guide/create-a-starter-app/).

Put this repo's files into the same directory, open them in a modern web
browser, and you should see the following:

![A HTML page with a big header 'PJ Old Town', followed by a
Esri map widget showing streets, and a horizontal status bar
saying "Rendering (coordinates) in 'streets-vector'."](screenshot.jpg)

The MapView is set to look at the longitude and latitude of Old Town in
Petaling Jaya, Malaysia.
